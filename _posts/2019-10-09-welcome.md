Welcome to nathan's notes! I intend to use this space to talk about anything from current events, travel, photography, math, data analysis, coding, philosophy, and religion. This will most likely involve deeper discussions that may not necessarily fit inside a 280 character limit.

As to when I post, it will be random. I can't make any promises on that. But I will make it interesting and insightful!

Thanks for reading and stopping by! Your presence has been
