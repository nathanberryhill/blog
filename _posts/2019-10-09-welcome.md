Howdy!

Welcome to Texas Toast! It consists of bite-sized insights and opinion pieces for just about anything from current events, travel, photography, math, data analysis, coding, philosophy, and religion. Sometimes this may involve deeper discussions that may not necessarily fit inside a 280 character limit.

As to when I post, it will be random. I can't make any promises on that. But I will make it interesting and insightful!

Thanks for reading and stopping by!
